                Welcome to WhyForecast! This is an online research study about a type of machine learning known as time series
                forecasting. The study consists of a short tutorial introducing the topic, followed by a series of
                multiple-choice exercises based on some real-world examples, and concludes with a short questionnaire. It will take
                roughly 25 minutes to complete.&#128515;


<!--                Welcome to our interactive platform designed to evaluate the clarity and usefulness of a time-->
<!--                series forecasting explanation method: TSFeatLIME. In this exercise, you'll have the opportunity to-->
<!--                interact with a time series forecasting machine learning model which uses electricity consumption and furniture-->
<!--                sales data as examples. You'll then assess how well this explanation method elucidates the underlying predictive model's decisions.-->
<!--                Before that, you have a chance to view a short tutorial on time series ensuring you understand some basic-->
<!--                concepts in time series forecasting. At the end of this study, you will also be presented with an evaluation-->
<!--                questionnaire.&#128515;-->
